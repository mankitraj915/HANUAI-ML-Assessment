The material is so soft and the features is great. You can skip or pause by clicking with your finger. It is so comfortable and has great noise cancellation. The design is so neat and stylish it has a clean look. The best thing about it is the cup is big and it didn’t hurt my ears. But the only thing concern about is the case holder is kinda big.

Cher12 - October,5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Blocks Noise & Plays Favorite Music Reviewed by Cher12 - October 12, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I absolutely love the Sony noise canceling headphones. They block out noise very well. I love that it has built-in Alexa and I can listen to my favorite music anytime. I never miss a phone call or notification because it will let you know when you have notifications. The built-in Alexa allows you to call someone whenever by simply asking. They fit so comfortably that you could wear them all day if you wish. The cushions are thick and fit snugly around the ears to block unwanted noise. Set up was very simple with easy to follow instructions by scanning the QR code provided. Very well constructed with obvious comfort and convenience in mind. They will come in very handy for us because our back yard is an interstate highway just beginning construction. My husband loves them too and is planning on using them when mowing and weed eating the lawn. They will come in handy when using his chainsaw to trim the many trees in the yard. They will work great for the woodwork he does too. I'm happy they will protect his hearing while working with loud tools and machinery. I will enjoy them while gardening or anytime. I can play music while working around the house without waking my husband when he's working nights. It makes me a happier person while listening to my favorite music. It's so easy by simply asking it to play what I'm in the mood to hear. Sound quality is great. I would recommend the Sony noise canceling headphones because you can listen to your favorite music and never miss a notification or phone call and it blocks out loud noise. It makes life much more enjoyable while protecting your hearing. Review originally posted on sony.com Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",Positive
H2ODogz - October,5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Feature rich and sound as great as they feel! Reviewed by H2ODogz - October 5, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After extensive use I can confidently say that Sony’s new WH-1000XM5 headphones are a tremendous leap forward from previous models and the competition.  The headphones themselves feel very sturdy and will not break from minor contact or pressure.  A big improvement from previous models is that these fold flat into their case in a very intuitive and natural manner, whereas older models I experienced required some twisting and I worried each time about exerting too much pressure and causing a break.  The weight seems much improved and even after hours of use I don’t experience any pressure points or fatigue on my head or ears.  My absolute favorite part of the WH-1000XM5 is the noise cancellation, which is superior.  The cancellation is adaptive and filters the majority of ambient or ancillary sounds without the need to run optimization.  For example, other brands I have used may filter the din of traffic and sidewalk sounds but when an ambulance zooms by its siren penetrates the level of active noise cancelling in place causing a startling intrusion of loud sound.  The WH-1000XM5 manages such abrupt changes in ambient sound perfectly and optimizes with immediate recalibration to the active filtration.  I have truly not experienced this level smart adjustment on any other brand or model except for Apple’s top model.  An additional feature that I absolutely love is that the headphones intelligently perceive when they have been removed and pause playback; and when put back on, playback resumes (perfect if responding to a quick question, waiter, etc.).  All of these features combine together to make the WH-1000XM5 my essential traveling companion.  As for sound quality, the WH-1000XM5 is impressive and consistent.  Bass is deep and strong, but not overbearing and never prone to distort.  Highs are crisp but not intrusive – I feel that they were likely tuned with a perfectly flat response, then a slight bass boost applied.  The result is perfect for my listening experience and I never EQ the sound playback that they receive.  In summary, I highly recommend the WH-1000XM5 and am confident that others will be as impressed with the features as I continue to be.

Cessnatim - May,5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones Reviewed by Cessnatim - May 27, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones

The Sony WH-1000XM5 are so impressive featuring new drivers with flagship superb features and design, active Noise Cancelling (ANC) Fantastic for home, office, travel the list is endless. Optimised for Alexa and Google Assistant.

The headphones are covered in a soft coating leatherette they are very comfortable to wear. One of the first things you notice when you open the box is the environmental packaging It's unbleached and wholly recyclable and uses no plastic whatsoever. The headphones are made mostly from Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) which is useful material in acoustic terms which is mostly produced from recycled plastic and can be recycled again at the end of its life. So full marks to Sony for doing this.

The Sony WH-1000XM5 main controls use capacitive touch panel on the right ear cup with actions as follows:

Swipe Up = Volume Up
Swipe Down = Volume Down
Swipe Forward = Track forward
Swipe Back = Track back
Hold (Centre) =Voice assistant
Double tap centre= Pause / resume
Cup hand =. Ambient sound pass through

On the left ear cup you will find two buttons, a power button and ANC mode button.Hold down the power button turns the headphones on after three seconds pairing will start, after that you can pair with your phone/computer.

 If you press NC/AMB button you can toggle the ANC mode, you are able to select the ANC/ANC off. The Ambient sound mode lets you hear what’s going on around you.

You connect the headphones via Blue tooth or a TRS cable. When you listen to the WH-1000XM5 via the wired connection you turn the headphones on and that enables the ANC or leave them off. They sound quite different in passive mode.

At the bottom right is a USB-C Charging port that allows you to charge the headphones.

The Sony Headphones Connect App works great with these headphones and I highly recommend that you download it. Also you can get the latest updates for your headphones.

Battery life for these Sony headphones is approx 30 hours on a full charge, if  the battery is flat you can charge for just 3 minutes you will get 180 minutes of playback or of course you can always use the 3.5mm cable for analog playback.

The headphones  tend too boost the bass a bit too much with a detriment of the midrange however by using the App you can use the equalisation feature to tailor to your liking. 

These Sony Headphones support Sony’s high bit rate codec called LDAC which gives very good sound quality. 

On using the wired connection I found the sound performance identical to the wireless mode but you need to make sure they are powered on, if you listen in passive mode performance is not so good.

The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones sport 8 microphones and the call quality is good and is excellent on zoom calls or phone meetings. It rejects outside noise well.

Overall these Sony headphones are a great buy but expensive, but if you want the best they are definitely worth the outlay. Review originally posted on sony.com Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",Positive
"NJuice - May 20,",5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Sony’s Best Noise Cancelling Headphones Yet Verified Buyer Reviewed by NJuice - May 20, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sony has been at the top of the line for years now when it comes to Noise Cancelling Headphones, and their latest addition continues that tradition. So far my experience with the WH-1000XM5 have been excellent!

UNBOXING & SETUP:
- Sony has really impressed me this time around with their minimalist packaging and unboxing. Its a subtle thing but its just nice that everything is recyclable and it does not come with a bunch of extra packaging, twist ties, and plastic wrap.
- Once you take them out of the carrying case, they are essentially ready to use! Just connect them to your phone / tablet / computer and you are ready to go!
- Sony recommends downloading their Sony Headphone App as well, which is definitely useful. Especially since it downloads any software updates needed for the headphones in the future.

PROS:
- I absolutely love the refreshed design on these! The XM3 / XM4 had the same design which was fine, but the XM5’s really have a more modern sleek look to them that are a big upgrade.
- I was very impressed with how light these are and how comfortable they are! Sony opted for more of a plastic feel to keep them lighter, but I don’t think it makes them feel cheap. I think it was the right choice to make to keep all day comfort in mind as well as portability.
- On that note, I wore these for a long time and they were comfortable the entire time. The adjustable headband is better fitting, the ear pads are comfortable, and they are not too tight at all.
- When I first put these on I was truly blown away at the Noise Cancelling. I have used plenty of noise cancelling headphones in the past, but these easily offer the best noise cancelling I have used. Instantly you are taken back by how much sound they drown out.
- The Sound Quality is of course exceptional! Everything I listen to is so crisp and offers a ton of clarity. The dialogue / vocals are excellent, the bass is impactful, and everything about the music or show you listen to just feels alive. Overall I am very pleased with how great these sound.
- The touch controls are once again excellent as well! You can pause, play, change tracks, change from noise cancelling to transparency mode, and if you hold your hand over the right touchpad you can quickly hear what’s going on around you which is an cool little trick.
- Taking calls on the XM5’s are fantastic as well! I can tell the call quality has improved and people have told me the mics sound great on their end as well. Definitely would be really easy to use for phone calls, work meetings, or gaming as well.
- Battery life is really solid too! 30 hours with ANC on, 40 without ANC, and they give you 3 hours of playback from 3 mins of charging if you are in a pinch.
- Lastly, the minor details all work well too! They still offer a aux port, still charge via USB-C, and the carrying case feels premium.

CONS:
- I do wish these had a waterproof design for use outdoors or while working out.
- The carrying case is larger than before since the headphones do not collapse/fold in, and instead just lay flat. However I still think the carrying case is really nice.

BOTTOM LINE:
- The Sony WH-1000XM5’s are simply the best Noise Cancelling Headphones you can buy! They offer superb Sound, Noise Cancelling, have great features, and are very comfortable! Plus Sony headphones just work with everything - Android, Apple, Windows, you name it. If you are in the market and want the best headphones possible, these are the ones to buy!

Trobadour - May,5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Beats the Competition Reviewed by Trobadour - May 25, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] --- SETUP ---
To set up these headphones, you must download the Sony Headphones app.  From there, follow the on-screen instructions to connect them via bluetooth to your mobile device.  

--- FEATURES ---
8 microphones for active noise canceling (ANC) exceptionality, bluetooth and auxiliary options, USB-C charge, 3 minute charge gives 3 hours of use, 4 microphones for voice precision, capacitive touch controls, auto-ambience features, and 30 hours of continuous use.  

--- PERFORMANCE AND EXPECTATIONS ---
Visually, these headphones didn’t stand out much compared to other headphones I’ve owned.  In fact, they are prone to getting oily quickly and don’t scream quality at first glance.  However, what it lacks visually more than makes up with its superb features.   

The over-the-ear cup design makes these one of the most comfortable headphones I’ve worn to date.  It helps that they are light to wear and its minimalistic design makes it intuitive to use the controls available.  The headband has a memory foam that lies comfortably on your head for extended periods of time.  The true value of these headphones comes with the customization provided for you in the free Sony app.  

Within the Sony app, you can turn on several features that are unique to scenarios you may encounter.  For example, these headphones come with superb ANC technology.  What this means is that the embedded 8 microphones on the headphones turn on to block ambient sound around you and make your listening experience sound as if you are listening to your audio in a vacuum, allowing you to truly focus on what you’re listening to.  In the app, you can turn on a feature that will automatically turn off the ANC if you start talking with someone so that you can clearly hear them.  At that point, the microphones will capture the voice of the person talking to you, and you will hear them through the headphones.  This is great if all you plan to do is listen to your audio.  However, if you like singing along to your tunes, it doesn’t work so well.  Since it’s a feature you can turn on or off, you can decide what you prefer. 

Similarly, if you have the auto-ambient feature off, you can still turn off ANC temporarily and quickly with the intuitive touch-capacitive controls.  Place the palm of your hand on the right ear cup and your music will automatically fade and ANC will turn off, allowing you to listen to what you need to listen to.  Imagine being on a subway and you need to hear the stop.  This would be an ideal use of the quick ANC turn-off feature.  

The headphones also detect when you remove them.  Doing so, it pauses what you are listening to, including watching shows from a streaming service.  This is a feature that I enjoyed more and more because it’s just practical.  

The headphones feature 360 Reality Audio.  For it to work, you need to take pictures of your ears within the app, the pictures are sent to a Sony server to be analyzed, and in return, you get a personalized 360 audio experience with specific apps.  Some require a subscription.  However, you can try the feature with the free 360 Reality Audio.  I followed instructions and set up my personalized audio experience with the 360 Reality Audio app.  I listened to the audio before and after the analysis of my ears.  I personally didn’t find a difference, but the sound of the headphones is enjoyable nonetheless.  

--- VALUE ---
These headphones have the right amount of well thought out bells and whistles that are useful, practical, and easy to understand to justify their price.  

--- APPROVAL ---
I highly recommend the headphones for the person who considers themselves an audiophile, the student who wants no outside disturbance while studying, or for the person who simply wants the best audio combined with the best comfort for extended periods of time!

"JKinSYR - May 23,",5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Top notch noise canceling with a nice style Reviewed by JKinSYR - May 23, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Right out of the box I was so excited to pair these Sony WH-1000XM5 with my iPhone 13 Pro.  Simply need to put it into pairing mode and it was ready within seconds.  Download the Sony Headphones app from the App Store and my headphones were ready to be used to the fullest.

The technology that Sony has paired into this set of headphones is impressive.  Noise-canceling on this pair of headphones is impressive.  I can't hear much of any external noise when I'm around noisy environments.  Working from home I can't hear the cooling fan, external speaker, or vacuum when the noise canceling is active.  Even more impressive is the sound quality on phone calls or online web meetings.  I had my music speaker on 40% volume during a phone call and the other party couldn't hear my music, as only my voice was making it through to them.

Sony has crafted a pair of smart headphones with advanced technology built into them.  One QN1 noise-canceling processor paired with the Integrated V1 processor can really cancel out the background commotion.  There are a total of eight microphones that are actively monitoring external noise to give you the best audio experience as a headphone user.  Inside the ear cups are 30mm drivers that do an exceptional job at sound quality for crisp high notes and deep bass notes as well.  With the app, you can easily fine-tune the sound preference which suits your hearing best.  There is built-in AI in the form of DSEE Extreme to help upscale compressed digital music files to ensure that I'm getting a full experience for my music of choice.  Four beamforming microphones on this pair of headphones are designed to capture your voice in full clarity and precision.  Hands-free operation is possible with the touch interface that can be turned on/off through the app.  The right ear cup allows for volume and music controls for example.  These particular headphones also have the ability to pause your music when you start to speak so you can converse when needed, and this feature can be turned on/off via the app.  Also depending on your movements, the ANC will adjust in case you're moving around your home or various locations, and this feature took me some getting used to but can be turned on/off via the app.  Alexa is also built-in and can be activated if you choose to.  Pair these Sony headphones easily to two devices at the same time, which has been helpful for listening to music from my iPhone and then connecting to my Windows laptop for a virtual meeting.

There is a nice hardshell case that comes with these to help protect this luxury set of headphones.  Also included in the case is a 3.5mm gold plate L-shape audio wire so you can listen to your headphones with a wired connection if you choose to.  Also, there is a USB-PD cable for charging purposes.  Battery life is stated to be up to 30 hours of total play, and you can get a 3-hour charge in just 3 minutes with the provided USB-PD compatible AD adapter.  The overall fit of these headphones is really nice.  I can wear these for long periods of time without feeling discomfort.  The pads are large and soft with the leather encircling your ear in full.  The headphones are adjustable with nice smooth and quiet movement across the headband, without clicking to set a place on your headband size.  The look and design of these headphones are very upscale and minimalistic which I like because I don't want to be flashy with branding and attract attention with my headphone choice.  

For me, this has been a great set of headphones so far for home usage and while commuting.  They offer incredible noise cancellation and truly are one of the best sets I have ever used.  The style is elegant and upscale.  This is a luxury set of headphones meant for use in stationary settings and multi-tasking.  I would not recommend using these for any exercise or precipitation weather, since there is not an IPX rating.

PRO:
Noise-canceling technology is top-notch
The style looks really nice
Sony app offers many options to maximize the headphones
All-day comfort

CON:
Cautious to use while exercising due to lack of IPX rating Review originally posted on bestbuy.com Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",Positive
TECHBEENGOOD -,5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Sony’s newest cocoon of sound perfection Reviewed by TECHBEENGOOD - May 20, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sony - WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise-Cancelling Over-the-Ear Headphones (Black)
There should be no doubt that there is a battle for the top ranking in the category of noise-cancelling, audiophile level headphones. And, Sony puts serious effort into achieving that top spot. Sony’s best, this WH-1000XM5, is a work of technical excellence as well as sublime comfort and isolation from the world around you. Sound accuracy excels, and is infinitely modifiable via the constantly evolving SONY CONNECT APP. I’m going to describe the more special features from an end-user perspective and comment on my impressions regarding sound. The quick take: Wow. This is an exaltation of music against a backdrop of silence. These may well be the best noise-cancelling headphones this year and for a few years more.

Before I begin, however, I’d like to acknowledge another role my Sony headphones have played in the life of my music-loving family. My family is delighted when I get my newest Sony headphones. You see, I hand my previous versions down to my adult children or their children. In fact, I see my oldest (decades old) Sony headphones being used by my talented piano playing granddaughter, as she practices her lessons.  It’s her favorite way to practice, plugged into her electric piano. Like this current iteration, every Sony headphone becomes an instant classic and a desirable gift that keeps delivering beautiful music for generations. There are few of my indulgences that have had such a wonderful impact on my family.  

STAND-OUT FEATURES; WHY DO I CARE? and HOW DO THEY PERFORM?
• Bluetooth 5.0, provides simultaneous connection to two devices. With minimal effort, I can switch between my iPhones and my Mac laptop.. The Sony supports SBC, AAC and LDAC codecs; reception range extending up to 30 feet. 
• SPECIAL NOTE: It’s very easy to use the Bluetooth “2nd device” feature to connect to a Sony Bravia XR series TV. I can now find these headphones listed as an audio selection on my TV after connecting via Bluetooth. Selecting the 1000XM5 results in a personal, high quality sound system that is simply wonderful. Volume is controlled via TV volume or at the headphones (or App). 
• Sony WH-1000XM4 noise-canceling utilizes 8 microphones to broaden the range of environmental sounds which are reduced (or enhanced if desired). Control for noise reduction is centered in the App but includes automated features that optimize sound cancellation depending on where I am. Noise reduction is as good as anything I’ve ever witnessed. I had practically a rock concert playing in the background of this same room where I was testing this feature. In fact, I was forced to pull away from my ear at least one ear cup to determine exactly how loud the background system was playing, or if it was even still on. The Sony’s were successfully blocking EVERYTHING in the environment. It was an amazing noise cancellation performance. Droning, noisey equipment sounds (air conditioner, lawnmowers) never had a chance to break through. 
• During calls, 4 beam-forming microphones are calibrated to only pick up your voice even if there’s significant background noise. As you start your conversation, “Speak-to-Chat” automatically stops your music and mixes in ambient sound so the conversation is more natural even with the headphones remaining in place. All my calls are easily understood.
• Edge-AI (Artificial Intelligence), DSEE Extreme™ upscales compressed digital music files in real time. Dynamically recognizing instrumentation, musical genres and individual elements of each song, it restores high range sound lost in compression. I leave this on, but to be frank, everything just sounds greatly anyway. 
• Battery life is said to extend to 30 hours (I’m testing). Keep in mind that these headphones are wireless …. but only until you use that double ended headphone jack to plug into your computer or AV equipment. Listening doesn’t have to end because this wired use does not require battery power. 
• The case is an all new design, super compact, rugged, and contains the wire accessories safely and securely. 

THEY’RE HEADPHONES, so How do they sound?!?
ANY WAY YOU WANT. Seriously. The Sony WH-1000XM5 defy any effort you make to dislike them. Out of the box, I concluded that Sony was slightly emphasizing the low base. Everything else sounded balanced and natural to me. I flipped to the EQUALIZER page in the App, tapped the CLEAR BASS icon, and used the SLIDER just below the equalizer controls to dial back the base until it sounded more normal to my ears. I had another 5 bands of equalization to modify (MANUAL MODE) or I could select from some already customized sound contours. I chose not to change anything else. Your ability to modify, correct, distort and emphasize music or other programming is virtually unlimited. The simple fact is, the SONYs provide an underlying accuracy, delicacy, and expanded frequency range that gives us end users an unhindered platform to build on or subtract from. We’re in charge.

These are special sounding headphones, as detailed and natural as anything I’ve ever owned. I sampled Apple Music’s acoustic collection, modern and classics. I was especially interested in re-mastered Lossless versions of Beatles, Doors, Love and other artists from the 60s. I jumped forward in time to recent Justin Timberlake, Bruno Mars, Billie Eilish, and Charli XCX. Everything was a joyful presentation of detail, rhythm and dynamics. Every minute playing music, or listening to high quality TV programming, with the Sony WH-1000XM5 feels like the first time I’m hearing this music or programming. I have too much music and programming to explore, so I’m cutting off this review here. I can easily recommend these headphone. They’ll eventually, inevitably filter down to a family member who will love them as much as I do today. Review originally posted on bestbuy.com Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",Positive
"Rocket - June 3,",5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Wonderful, But Maybe sony Should Issue A Warning Reviewed by Rocket - June 3, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I always look forward to getting new tech. Less so, when I am replacing an item like for like due to a breakdown or fault. Less so too, if I’m just getting an upgrade to an existing piece of kit that I have. No, for me, the real excitement begins when I get a piece of tech that I haven’t owned/used before.

Step forth the Sony WH-1000XM5 Noise Cancelling Headphones. Sure I’ve had headphones, but not the noise cancelling variety. 

Resplendent and shiny new in what Sony describe as their environmental packaging initiative. No plastic in the packaging and the Product Box is made using Sony’s Original Blended Material. I took a further look in to this and it appears that the headphones are also made of recycled materials. I don’t tend to buy items based on their environmental credentials, but seeing the attention that Sony are giving to it, it clearly is something that a lot of people care about. I would even go as far as to say, it’s woken me up to the fact and I should be a little more considerate in my buying habits going forward.
 
The first impression you get is one of quality and environmental consideration. Nice one Sony. 
Once you get inside the box, which is worth keeping to protect your headphones case from future misdemeanours, you are greeted by a further case, this time in a grey hard cloth finish that is attractive and functional.

Undoing the gold zipper just helps build the anticipation and once fully opened you aren’t disappointed, though at first sight I am surprised at how little is in the case. But wait, those crafty folk at Sony have worked some magic and as I start to explore I realise that everything I need is in the pack. A discreet flap hides the location of the headphones cable and USB charging cable.

The first thing that strikes you is how beautifully styled the headphones are. Everything is colour matched in a quality matt black finish. They’re light and softly rounded rather than futuristically angular.They ooze quality.

Considering this was new tech to me, I was a little anxious about understanding and mastering it’s complexities. I needn’t have worried. The sleeve (Again in recycled material) that contains all the documentation shows a QR code that when scanned takes you to a User Manual for the headphones.
Next, download the Sony Headphones Connect App. Follow the instructions makes setting up the headphone's simple.

Sony have also included a variety of options that allow you to trial for free any one of four music streaming services that provide the 360 Reality Audio Experience. The good news is that the trials are for three months+ in most cases, giving you ample time to trial your chosen service. The concept of the 360 Reality Audio is that instead of you hearing the sound in just a stereo environment it is relayed to you as if you were in your very own musical sphere. I may not have done it justice with my description but I can promise you the most wonderful listening experience. Clarity and depth are the words that come to mind to describe it.   

To get the best listening experience you have to create your own personalised profile. Again, a  really simple experience that involves using an app to guide you. The app assesses the shape of your head and ears that allows the software to build a unique profile to enhance your  listening.

I saw a TV drama only a few days after I started using the WH-1000XM5’s and the lead character in it said she only listened to her music via headphones. Strangely, that is something I’ve begun doing myself since I got the headphones for all my music listening except when using the radio in the car.
 
The noise cancelling element of the headphones is brilliant. The first time I used them brought back to me a recent flight I took that lasted over four hours. Had I had the headphones then I would have used them to cut out all the background noise on the plane.  I fly about five times a year so they will be invaluable to enhance the quality of my journey.

In use, the headphones are simple to use. You can do most things by using the touch controls on the right headphone. You can play, stop, pause and skip through tracks while raising and lowering the volume just by moving you fingers in a particular direction. The same actions can be used when taking calls. If you cover the whole right headphone in the cup of your hand the sound is reduced to a mere whisper allowing you to listen more attentively to your surroundings. Combine this with the Ambient or noise cancelling button on the left headphone and you can alter the sound to include the local ambient noise or have noise cancelling on.

With music playing you can speak and the sound cuts out allowing you to hear your voice and locality more clearly. Any alerts on your phone are acknowledged with a sound in your headphones to keep you in touch with the rest of your social network.

Remove the headphones and the music playback pauses and restarts when you put them back on. So useful.

By now you may be beginning to realise how much I’ve fallen in love with my Sony WH-1000XM5 Noise Cancelling Headphones. I love them, and can’t believe I haven’t found myself searching them out before. 

I use them at my computer while working (Even wrote this review while using them). 

When my wife chooses to catch up on her soaps or talent shows of an evening I slip the headphones on and take myself to the immersive sound experience created by my WH-1000XM5’s.

However to conclude this review, a word of warning. When I started using them I found myself moving about the house singing along to the tunes I was listening to. I was having a great time until my enraged red faced wife tapped me on the shoulder and told me to stop the noise. Maybe Sony should put a warning on the packaging discouraging those of us that can’t sing to be mindful of others around us when we use them?

Shanedor90 - May,5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars A Small Improvement Makes for a HUGE Difference!! Verified Buyer Reviewed by Shanedor90 - May 21, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have had many headphones. I have had predecessors to these (both XM3 and XM4s) and i have had/still have multiple of the largest competitors. Recently I have been daily driving for work and leasure the Surface Headphones 2+ which I love (Seriously the ANC on these things are better than any of my others by a landslide, too bad their sound quality isnt as good).

So of course being headphone obsessed, I was sooo happy to hear the XM5s were coming and been reading up and prepping for today!! Had to drive 8 miles to a store partway across town to get the ""white"" pair but I got them! And I am not disappointed. Let's get into it!

Pros:
- Extremely light. Seriously these things just melt into your head. I would have had this review done hours ago BUT ended up listening to these for 6 hours because i just lost track of time and was wisked away in auditory bliss! Clamping force is super light though so not ideal for any as many action based activities.
- Easy to set up/pair. Out of the box all I did was turn them on and they popped up to pair with my Samsung S22 Ultra. Set up was easy with configuration taking about 15 mins to set my button maps, Google Assistant, 360 Audio, enable LDAC, and pick a decent EQ preset to start with (Im a ""bright"" fan dialed down 4 notches with a little amp in the upper mids for my Sonys). All up took about 40 mins to get them completely to my prefered settings with 
a few tweeks here and there throughout the listening period. 
-Long battery life. All up i used 18% today in over 6 hours. Then when I threw them on to charge they took less than an hour to top out!! INCREDIBLE battery which is no shock from Sony.
- Color/texture is gorgeous. As some reviews reported the ""white"" is more like a ""Stone Creme"" with some speckling to it. They have a matte finish and since people had reviewed saying the black smudged really easy I got white which really doesnt (plus i already had the denim blue XM4s and wanted these to really look different).
-Packaging/quality. Everything is ""classy"" i dont know why people say these feel ""cheaper"". Plastic is used in headphones for a reason. Take it from someone who used to daily drive all metal Dr. Dre Detox Edition Pros (it was a different time ya'll lets move past it), you dont want that much weight and clamp force when doing 6,8, or 10 hours of listening in a day. These shave weight while staying sophisticated. I like it.
- Sound quality. These things are SOOOO punchy i love it! That Carbon 30mm driver really is putting in work and its great at what it does. Less boom than the XM4s, much tighter ""poppy"" flavor to the bass notes (seriously go pull up Billie Jean - MJ with these and you'll see what i mean). Just very adaptable sound profile that really bring well mastered music to life! Don't believe me? Throw on ""Reckoner""-Radiohead, or any ""Off the Wall"" - MJ track and have your jaw dropped!! Like your in the studio.

Cons: 
- Pricey. This being the most expensive XM line item is hard to swallow. Are they worth it. I feel like yes. They bring more to the table than my Bose 700 for the same price. But still, price creep is present and could price these out of range for target customers who would love them. That's ok though, wait for black friday when the hit $349 or dare I say $329 then snag you a pair.
- Portability. If you've looked into these you know this complaint. They don't fold in so harder to transport. Not really a major issue but noteworthy. Moving on...
- ANC. It may just be how spoiled i have got with my Surface Headphones but i was slightly underwhelmed by the ANC. With my Surface Headphones i can snap right in front of my face at high-medium volume and not hear a peep. These i could snap at almost out stretched arm and still hear it at similar volume very clearly. Not too worried though as Sony is great at improving via firmware updates; but for launch day I'm a bit disappointed considering how much they hyped up how much they had improved. Still does the job just want more.
- Included ""charge cable"".....seriously Sony.....its like 4 inches.....wire is not that expensive. I know you kept it short so it better fit in the magnetic case pocket but seriously what charger/situation is that gonna work with unless with a pc port or a table top usb hub. Do better for $400.
- App. The app is very buggy right now. Setting up Google assistant it crashed twice and hung during registration at the start. Again this is day one stuff so you HAVE to expect that things like that aren't gonna be perfect and will improve but want to inform potential buyers so they are bummed by it.
- LDAC unavailable for dual device mode. This isn't really a con, just a hope. In order to have dual device pairing LDAC is disabled. Im assuming it is due to bandwidth limitations caused by dual stream splitting the avaiable bandwidth but sucks having to enable it every time i go back to single mode. At least make it so they remember i had it on before dual device mode and have it automatically turn on.

With that, we're done with the major stuff. I hughly recommend these. They are so light, comfortable, and sound amazing. If you're coming from the XM4s I can't say that they are necessarily an ""upgrade"" but more just a variant. The sound is just different enough to give a different experience, and honestly i think it makes these an even better all arounder than the XM4s were. Most of the issues will be patched in the coming weeks, and then these will be slayers!! They are definately gonna be daily driven with me for the next few months to put them through their paces. I would have loved to see aptX for PC and something like Team Certification given the events that have occured in business/workplace since the XM4 that i could use in my work, but that was prolly wishful thinking. Overall strong 5/5 and so happy to finally have them in my hands. But ultimately everyone's preferences will impact their thoughts on them so get out there, get yours and decide for yourself.

Happy listening. Review originally posted on bestbuy.com Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",Positive
"_b12 - May 30,",5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Brilliant steep forward Reviewed by _b12 - May 30, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] ## Design
- No folding available in this iteration, just the usual cup tilt and pan. Works for me, don't mind the lack of foldability.
- I personally appreciate the new design and can describe it as far more sturdy and quality feel. No more plasticy sounds when adjusting the headphones or moving your head
- The cups are comfortable, with memory foam, coated with some kind of artificial leather
- The proximity sensor is no longer visible(compared to M4), but is still there
- Headband is comfortable and narrower. However, when at the gym and bench-pressing/dumbbell fly they still slide back off my head.
- Approx. 5gr lighter on the scales than previous models. I can't really tell the difference when wearing either model, so doesn't make a difference to me but appreciate the change.
Overall a welcome change. The cups seem a bit thicker in profile than previous iterations but overall with same comfort and nice fake leather coating material. Those are a fingerprint magnet(if you have the black headphones). Yet I prefer this design. The mics are quite visible though and given the grills are the trademark bronze/gold colour they stand out. Not really a fan of that color choice but given what it provides in other departments I have made my piece with it. Might not be for anyone. Definitely though would prefer the mics grills color to be same as the cups color.

## Active Noise Cancelling and mics
- 7 visible mics positioned strategically around the ear cup for noise cancelling and voice calls
- wind noise reduction is significantly improved (in NC mode only) - while listening and for the other side of a phone call
- voice calls recipients no longer complaint about muffled or unclear speech, difference is quite audible.
- Adaptive mode is very accurate in changing profiles both action and location based. Super useful in your everyday commute, gym, run/walk and in the office due to personalised ambient sound levels available through the app. You can save frequent locations with predefined ANC/ambient sound levels. Manually entered several of those and all worked well. But that is more on usability and the mobile app, yet worth mentioning.
Overall very happy with the improvement in noise cancelling, especially in windy conditions such as the one I encounter every day in my park walks. Gym feeling is the same top notch.

## Buttons, controls and inputs
- Same two button operation plus the same gesture controls as before: double tap, swipe up/down/left and right and tap and hold with palm
- Still no dedicated button for multipoint connection control. You can pair the headphones with two devices and switch between them but only through the app. I really believe a dedicated button provides far better user experience
- Same USB-C charging with fast charging available
- Same audio cable provided to connect to your device if you do not want to use wireless
- Same touch controls on the right cup, quite responsive and with nice sound feedback

## Connectivity
- BT 5.2 - I appreciate that every iteration is supporting the latest BT protocol
- Same frequency response as previous models in wired or wireless mode

## Features
- Supports most Digital assistants - Google/Alexa/Siri
- Connected apps option - chose what connected and supported app to run when double or triple clicking the NC button. I am using Spotify and when double click the NC button music starts playing from that app.
- Speak-to-chat feature where once you speak transparency mode is activated until your voice is no longer picked by the headphones mics(5/15/30s or auto timeout). No more sing along in this mode :)
- Battery life claimed is same as previous models - around 30h. I managed to get ~22h(100% down to 20%) with adaptive mode on and volume 30-50% . Quite a good deal. It could be different for you based on your prefered volume levels, EQ and NC mode. Worth noting that I received a firmware upgrade(1.1.1) right after the test.

## Sound
- Playing the same song with default EQ seem to give this new XM5 a clearer mid-range than previous iterations(XM3 and XM4). For the casual listener I doubt it would make any change. For me personally I always use the EQ to adjust mid-high frequencies and also crank up the Clear Bass to +7. You must hear it for yourself with your favourite track to be able to appreciate the difference.
- Quite a big technical change is the new drive - 30mm down from 40mm but with some better insulation and lighter mats such as carbon. Frequency response is same both wired and BT. All that signifies a change in the drive cavity and how bass resonates to produce the same quality low frequencies.
- Each and every one of us has slightly different sensitivity for different frequency bands and self preferences as well therefore a head to head comparison of the output over a microphone(with different frequency sensitivity bands and possibly remastered post recording) gives some perspective but is in no way a fair depiction of what you, yourself, might take out of those headphones(or any audio device for that matter) and classify as ""good"" or ""bad"".
Overall seem like an improvement(in the mid-range frequencies) and very much so appreciated. An audiofile will definitely hear a difference if comparing with predecessor. I still do and yet I am not a professional audio engineer.


Given everything I mentioned, if you had any previous WH1000X model, I can describe this new one as a good step forward. In any other case prepare to be blown away. Coming from the other two brands competing with Sony will still feel very different and an improvement in most aspects. A very welcome upgrade I'd say - noise cancellation, audio quality, connectivity(with the exception of multipoint management) are all top level. A must have for travel on the tube, going to the gym or for a walk in the park. Adaptive ANC is brilliant.
I very much want to see a hardware change for multipoint device management on the headphones themselves. Maybe a dedicated button to switch between connected/registered devices. Also, can't wait to see what Sony can offer in future iterations with regards to further improving noise cancelling, especially dynamic wind noise removal and would they offer multi-drive and true DD5.1(that would be amazing!) version of this product one day.

willliamches -,5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars If you work from home get this headset Verified Buyer Reviewed by willliamches - March 22, 2024 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I went through at least 6 different headsets. Work from home in a very loud environment. All of them lacked something, either a good microphone that will block the background noise, battery life, not comfortable to wear, or a combination of them. And we have a clear winner. 
Perfect and smooth calls with no background noise heard for yourself or the person you are talking to (even with a screaming baby by your side) lightweight and comfortable to wear for hours, amazing carrying case, multi-device connectivity and voice control, the Sony headset app has ton of features that you can customize according to your needs, battery life is superb.

"Bear - June 4,",5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Sound Quality At It’s Best Reviewed by Bear - June 4, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The connection to my new Sony headphones via Bluetooth was extremely easy, the headphones themselves ooze quality and are comfortable, even when worn for long periods of time, this is probably helped by there light weight. The sound quality is out-standing and even when listening to an audio book in a very noisy environment, the noise cancellation works very well, letting you hear just what you want to hear, even the carry case is well designed.

VoltageSky - May,5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Worthy to carry the legacy name Verified Buyer Reviewed by VoltageSky - May 21, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The design is the first change I took noticed. While I do miss the swivel/folding aspect of the xm4; this isn’t an issue in the slightest. It does feel a bit lighter and the cushions are comfortable. I’m getting vibes of the AirPods Max overall minus the metal components. The case is nice with a central compartment to hold the cables. The stock sound signature without the use of EQ’s is amazing.  The details on every level (lows, mids, highs) is prominent. Additional mics improve ANC & clear phone calls. It also boast the newest Bluetooth codec (5.2). Is it worth the upgrade over the xm4s? Probably not. But from the xm3s or your first pair of 1000x series, definitely worth the purchase. Review originally posted on bestbuy.com Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",Positive
Yogi2727 - December,2,"Customer rating: 2 out of 5 stars Strong Features, Serious Structural Concerns Verified Buyer Reviewed by Yogi2727 - December 9, 2025 I purchased these headphones during the Black Friday sale and was initially impressed with their performance. Upon testing, I found them to be lightweight with a secure fit and exceptional active noise cancellation capabilities. The overall sound quality and design met my expectations.
However, within one week of use, I noticed a hairline fracture developing on the ear cup. Upon investigation, I discovered this appears to be a widespread manufacturing defect, with numerous user reports documenting similar issues. Given the prevalence of this problem, I made the difficult decision to return the headphones rather than risk receiving another pair with the same defect.
While the product offers good value for the price point, the structural integrity issue is a significant concern that warrants resolution before purchase. Potential buyers should be aware that the durability of this model remains questionable until the manufacturing defect is addressed.

KitchenAid - May,2,"Customer rating: 2 out of 5 stars Not impressed by the ""new"" Verified Buyer Reviewed by KitchenAid - May 27, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I don't think I've EVER purchased a ""new"" ""upgraded"" so called ""next gen"" tech item, and then so VERY much wanted my old one back.  I had the XM4's headphones these XM5's aren't better or improved, to me.  I paid $160 to upgrade and lost features! 
I prefer the old ear shape, I prefer that when I used to fold them into their case then I could also put them away in purse.  The XM5 case to too large for any purse, I can see that it's flatness of the XM5 case may be convenient for a backpack.  I expected there to be a GOOD REASON for their ""new"" shape, but I haven't found it.  The stem (or whatever you call the part) that connects the headphone to the headband part seems less sturdy, than the flatter ""stem"" of the XM4's.  **Photographed are my XM2's, but I used the 4's that were still under warantee thinking I was going to get a better product... I didn't get a better product, and with warrantee these set me back over $500.  For that I need to be impressed and I'm not.

Wow what a phenomenal product! Having read all the publicity material about this product,
what it didn’t make clear, was the breadth of opportunity to fine tune your listening using a very well designed app downloaded to your smartphone. Connection to all my devices laptop, pc and smartphone was very easy and the soft ear shells are so light and comfortable.
I have only had the unit for a couple of weeks but the performance using both Bluetooth and the connecting cable is excellent. Re-charging the unit battery is necessary if you choose to maximise the use the noise cancelling feature and the voice assist functions. Charging is quick and a good battery power up time is confirmed. The voice guidance was a pleasant surprise when my battery needed charging.
Connecting to multiple devices is easy using the app. By using the comprehensive online “Help Guide” and the “Headphones Connect app”, I have been able to troubleshoot issues caused by my setting experimentation! There is so much more to enjoy and explore for me. This product will change your listening pleasure taking account of your location with any background noise whilst linked to multiple devices.

"Andy68 - May 26,",4,"Customer rating: 4 out of 5 stars Good, but not perfect. Reviewed by Andy68 - May 26, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Like recent Sony headphones, the WH-1000XM5 come in highly recyclable packaging that still feels high quality and unboxing is a pleasant experience.

The provided case is compact and the headphones fold very flat. There will be no problem slipping them in to a small bag.

The headphones are light but still feel reasonably well made.

The fit is great. Very comfortable and sound isolation, even switched off, is very impressive.
The noise cancelling is the best I've heard and I'd feel very confident taking these headphones on a long haul flight knowing their 30 hours battery life, and comfort and noise cancelling would ease my time away.

Its not all roses though. The sound is competent and reasonable well rounded but there is definitely a closed in feeling that you don't get with some other premium noise cancelling headphones. At best, is steals the ambience from the music and the soundstage is muddled. At worse it sounds like listening to music in a wooden box.

I have another pair of premium brand over ear noise cancelling headphones that are about 8 years old that I find much more enjoyable to listen to.

There is a lot to like here and the sound presentation maybe to others taste, but I felt is was a little disappointing. Review originally posted on sony.com Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",Positive
Julie22 - October,5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Great sound quality/best noise canceling hdphones Reviewed by Julie22 - October 7, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was excited to start using Sony's WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones. I am currently typing this review while wearing the headphones!  First of all, the headphones are stored in a sleek carrying case.  There is a pocket for the headphone wired jack/cable and charger cable (very short cable?). Beautiful case, but bigger than previous model as this model's headphones do not fold up? Sound is AWESOME.  Noise cancelling feature is FANTASTIC.I cannot hear much outside noise when I have these headphones on.  Earpads are very very soft and comfortable. Hope the material on the earpads last after prolonged usage. Headband hurts a bit at the top of my head as it weighs down a bit, but that can be just me - I have a sensitive head.  Overall, a snug fit -- not too tight.  Learning curve was a bit tougher as I am older - but my son had the headphones up and running and playing around with its features in 15 seconds flat!!!!  Meanwhile,  I had to download Sony's headphone software onto my  iPhone. Do that as there are instructions in the app. Plus, you can set it up to link to Spotify, etc. and use the touch controls - for example, swiping up on the right headphone raises the volume, swiping down decreases volume, double tab pauses the music, forward swipe forwards to next song, taking off headphones shuts off power, etc.  These touch features are really snazzy when working correctly, but then I've experienced glitchiness as well. Lots of other features on the app  you can play with and customize to your liking.  I like the fast charging of battery and LONG battery life - big plus for me.  DEFINITELY WILL COME IN HANDY TO NOT ALWAYS BE WORRYING ABOUT CHARGING HEADPHONES! I foresee myself using this pair of headphones quite often!

DoctorSimon31 -,5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Studio Quality, comfortable and clever to boot! Reviewed by DoctorSimon31 - June 5, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] What a great set of high quality, noise cancelling headphones from Sony!

For comfort, they are light and highly adjustable, with soft ear cups and headband, ensuring they stay in place as well as not becoming irritable after a period of time. This is just as well as the battery life is exceptional, with 30 hours on a full charge and 3 hours in just 3 mins. 

There is a handy red dot above the right cup, inside the headband to quickly remind you which way round to put them on! When first worn, even powered off, you have a sense of complete cover over the ear and how immediately the ambient sound is reduced. Then when turned on and the noise cancelling is activated, almost no ambient sounds can be heard. Then play some music and forget about around you!

The Headphones Connect app from Sony is essential: it enables scenario specific noise cancelling through the Adaptive Sound Control, according to the activity and location, and even learns your preferences. You are even able to control the amount of ambient noise allowed in. All of this is cleverly managed by microphones inside and outside the ear cup. A true test of the noise cancelling was while mowing the lawn: very impressive.

There are a multitude of settings and functions available within the app, too many to go through here, but one that I have found extremely useful is being able to connect to two devices at once. Using the Headphones Connect app while connected to my TV or laptop allows control of the functions while listening to another source. 

Beyond the app, there is an intuitive touch control pad on the flat side of the right cup. Volume, track choice and call receiving all wok using taps and swipes. The clarity that the microphones provide in call is envied by those that I´m talking to: they find it difficult to believe I´m using headphones.

Be patient for a software update, when it occurs, but nice to see regular support through the app.

Still trying to get to grasp with all of the functions, like Speak-to-chat and the seriously useful Pause when headphones taken off, especially when watching a film and an inevitable interruption; I am thoroughly enjoying this impressive high quality product from Sony.

"Raff - May 31,",4,"Customer rating: 4 out of 5 stars Almost perfection Reviewed by Raff - May 31, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First, my qualifications.  I am retired now, but was a professional player, arranger, and conductor.  I have listened to music through headphones and speakers all my life and am very conversant with what is needed to convey the quality of a performance. 

I listen to extremely dynamic music, both in range and power (which translates as volume on listening devices).  My taste ranges from Renaissance to Electronic music and from Jazz to Heavy Metal.  

I listen mainly to .wav (lossless) format files.  Therefore I need headphones to be able to convey the extremes of power with the same accuracy throughout the range; not to lose anything really soft, nor to be distorted at the other end of the spectrum.

QUALITY  As expected from Sony, the quality and presentation of these headphones is of the highest.  

They have their own case that also contains the headphone jack for direct listening and a USB-C cable for recharging.  

The matt finish does tend to show grease marks, but these are easily wiped away.

OPERATIONS.  They are intuitively easy to operate, just one button for on/off and one for Noise Cancelling/Ambient listening.  

Bluetooth connects immediately and there was no difficulty in getting any of my devices to recognise the headphones.  

I charged them as soon as they arrived and after about an hour's use they were down to 45% charge, but I expect that to improve as the batteries get up to operating standard.

PERFORMANCE.  I didn't research these headphones when they arrived, because I didn't want to be influenced by anything before I tried them. I could see that they were very well made, but I had no idea of the cost so didn't know what to expect regarding sound quality.  

Having tried the Ambient setting, I now exclusively use Noise Cancelling, which is remarkable and I have to rely on the dog to tell me whenever anyone is rapping on the front door, next to where I'm sitting. 

I could eulogise about how rich and sonorous the reproduction is from these headphones, but I don't really have the vocabulary that HiFi buffs have.  All I can say is that the sound is the best I've heard from headphones.  I don't think it's possible to exactly reproduce the aural experience of sitting in a concert hall with good acoustics, because of all the atmosphere that microphones can't garner, but these headphones are the next best thing.

So why only four stars? Because they become slightly uncomfortable after only a short time as my ears got hot.  I suppose it's part of the Noise Cancelling design, but, although bearable, it is a relief when I take them off.  Having said that, I listen to works lasting hours rather than minutes, so perhaps I'm not the typical user.

VERDICT.  Outstanding! Review originally posted on sony.com Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",Positive
"blah - May 25,",5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Great headphones! Just wish they folded down again Reviewed by blah - May 25, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great headphones!! Just wish they folded down like last year’s model, in a more compact way for travel.

Great packaging, no plastic, environmentally friendly. Comes with a great case, however this year’s upgrade on these over the ear headphones doesn’t fold down, and just turn the earcups down, so the case is just physically larger. It isn’t a huge deal, but it does take a little more space if you travel. The good news is the case is really good, and has a great little separate compartment for your cables, charger, etc.

The design of this year’s XM5, seems to use some kind of synthetic leather, and feels fantastic to the touch, and seems a bit lighter than last year's XM4s. The XM5s look very modern, and radically different to last year's model, and I think they look great. The XM5s use a smaller 30mm driver, and while they do still sound good, the XM4s have stronger bass. I personally feel the XM4s sound a little bit better, however I like heavy bass in music. The XM5s still sound great, but it might not be quite as good in the bass department for some users due to the smaller 30mm driver, vs the XM4s 40mm drivers. The app on android / iOS has tons of great functionality, and a great little equalizer presets, and the ability to customize your own equalizer settings and save it to a custom preset saved to the app and headphone itself.

A note on charging. The battery life on these is great!! I seem to be getting around 25 hours on a full charge or so in my use case so far with ANC turned on most of the time. And, while I feel that is great, what is even more awesome is that if I am in a rush to get somewhere, and only have a few minutes to charge, I can get about 3 hours of battery time in less than 5 minutes!!! That is great, as I sometimes forget to charge before needing to jump on a train or bus.

Noise cancellation is great, as expected. It isn’t quite a huge jump in noise reduction vs the XM4s, however it is definitely better. I absolutely love the ear cups in the XM5s. The XM4s ear cups were a bit too shallow for my ears, and would eventually rub against my ears a little. There is more room in these now, and don’t touch my ears anymore. I love the speak to chat function via the app, where the XM5s can sense you talking while listening to music, and will temporarily pause, push in sound from the outside via the microphones, and you can hear who you are talking to while not removing the headphones. It works really well, and is great around my home where if I see someone in my home trying to speak to me while I have the ANC turned on, I just “speak to chat”, and can hear them. Stop talking after a short while, and it will resume playing your music or media sound from your connected device. Another great thing is that these headphones can be connected to 2 devices simultaneously. I use these with my Pixel 6, and also my Window 11 laptop, and move from taking voice calls via google voice app, and music back and forth. Works great!! I cannot ever imagine not having this in headphones.

Call quality is very good, and it does seem to be a bit better than the XM4s. I think this is because the XM5s have more microphones on this year’s model.

Love these headphones! Just wish they figured out a way to collapse the headphones like last years model. It isn’t a deal breaker for me, but these are just a little more difficult to fit in a tight bag. But, the sound quality is still phenomenal, ANC is the best available, and the speak to chat option is amazing (it can be disabled by the way.) Highly recommended!!!

The headphones come in Sony’s eco friendly packaging. Inside the packaging you’ll find the headphones in their case. The case has a large-ish footprint, but it feels slim. It’s made of high quality, durable materials. Unzipping the case you’ll find the headphones. They don’t fold like previous models (hence, the larger case) but the ear cups turn to make them flat. Inside the case is a magnetic flap that opens with a gentle pull that reveals a USB-C charging cable and 3.5 MM to 3.5 MM audio cable to connect your headphones to an audio jack. Unlike my older Bose models, the audio cable plug is full size on both ends of the cable. (making them interchangeable). 

SETTING UP
If you wanted, you could simply charge these headphones up, turn them on, connect to your phone and begin listening to music. But I recommend downloading the Sony Connect App as a part of this process. There, you can change some of the noise canceling settings (like adaptive noise canceling, turning off music when someone is talking, or change the EQ levels). More importantly, that’s where you get the firmware updates. I suspect they’re not necessary, but are highly recommended to keep the headphones operating at their best. 

DESIGN
The MX5s updated their design from the MX3 and MX4. They now more closely resemble the new Bose headphones which isn’t really a bad thing. I didn’t hate the MX3 or MX4 designs, nor did I love them. They were headphones. The MX5s, however, look more sleek.But functionality is what counts, specifically comfort. 

There’s seemingly no metal in these headphones. I’m guessing to keep their weight down. Part of me wishes the band was made out of metal, purely for durability’s sake, but these seem to handle what you can throw at them (within reason of course). You can grab the cans and twist and turn and the headband snaps back into place with ease. 

The headband is obviously adjustable, like virtually all over the ear headphones. Here there’s no clicking, the band adjusts with virtually little friction as the arms slide in and out of the headband itself. 

The ear cups are huge. I have a big head, thus big ears, and most ear cups lay partially on my ear which causes discomfort over time. With the MX5s, my entire ear fits inside the cup so there’s no pinch points. I’m not sure if it’s in my head, but my ears feel cooler too. Maybe it’s because they’re not getting squeezed? The cushions feel like some kind of pleather, you push in and and they feel like memory foam (they’re not, but do feel cushiony). 

Last, I’ll just say that they are extremely light. So much so, you’d have no problem wearing them hours on end if you chose to. I don’t think you’ll ever forget they’re there, in my opinion, no such world exists where you don’t feel like you’re wearing headphones, but it comes close. 

EASE OF USE
If you’ve owned a pair of MX headphones before, the navigation will be very familiar to you. The outside of the right ear cup is touch sensitive. You simply swipe left or right to advance (or go back) tracks, and swiping up and down controls the volume. I very much prefer this design over hard buttons because they have a little room for error in terms of locating any buttons. There’s a power button as well as an ANC button. Turning ANC effectively turns the outer microphones on and projects ambient noise inside your headphones. I try to avoid ever turning ANC off, but I can see where this is a neat or even essential feature for some, especially crossing crowded streets. 

SOUND QUALITY AND NOISE CANCELING
The noise canceling is superb. It’s almost too good. Like, where do we go from here? Or, it seemingly feels so quiet it’s creepy. I don’t put on noise canceling headphones to simply cancel the noise, I use them in conjunction with listening to music or podcasts. But I tried it out and if that’s your thing (literally no noise) then these are the best headphones on the market now. Now, to be fair, it doesn’t eliminate all noise; I could hear a loud passenger jet pass over my head (I’m just a couple of miles from the airport). But everyday sounds essentially disappeared.

In terms of sound quality, I have to say it’s great. I’m no audiophile by any stretch, but I can certainly appreciate quality sound. I’ve listened to everything from classical, to rap, to pop to 80s rock. And they all sound terrific. The default setting doesn’t have the deep bass the MX3s and MX4s are known for; the default seems to emphasize the treble and mid range. But if you were missing that deep bass, you can go into the Sony Connect app and can fine tune the EQ or preset EQs to get the sound you preferred. There’s a lot of customization in the app to make everyone happy. I stuck with the default settings because I liked the crisp sound.

OTHER FEATURES
I previously mentioned the app. It does a little more than push firmware updates and allow you to adjust the EQ settings. Here you can set up Sony’s 360 degree audio features. The headphones, through your phone, examines the shape of your ears and tweaks the settings for optimum performance. Unfortunately, I haven’t tried this feature because (my assumption) there’s a pay wall behind this content (and only select apps support it). Probably the coolest feature is adaptive sound, which tracks how you wear your headphones to optimize the noise canceling and sound settings.You can also turn on the feature that pauses your music automatically if the headphones sense you talking. For example, someone walks up to you and asks you a question while you’re listening to music, it will automatically pause so you can communicate with said person. The music will automatically continue after a set duration of time (which can be changed in the app). While I liked the feature as it was intended, it prevents me from singing along to the music. Once it detects your own voice, when you’re belting out your favorite song, the music will pause. So, unfortunately for me I had to turn that setting off.
CONCLUSION
There’s tons and tons of headphone options on the market. The Sony MX5s are certainly not cheap. But if sound and noise canceling matters enough to you, this is the pair to get. I’m sure there are other headphones that sound just as good, but you really can’t beat the combination of sound quality, noise cancelation and design. 

Last, I’ll just say that the case is a tad bigger than previous Sony models or even the Bose QC45, but I didn’t find it to be that big of a deal. It would be nice if they folded up to a smaller package, I have to believe that the Sony engineers had good reason not to. Either way, I wouldn’t let the size of the case or the headphones inability to “fold up” sway your decision to get these or not.

Runner123 - October,5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Amazing Reviewed by Runner123 - October 5, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am in love with Sony’s headphones! These are nothing but exceptional! 
They came in a case box that is perfect for storing when not in use. And it’s easy to store. 
The blue tooth paring capability is perfection. I was and continue to be able to pair once my bluetooth is on and the headphones are on. It is easy for me to also pair with my peloton and connects seamlessly. 
Now the noise…stunning! I cannot hear anything around me while I am working, working out or just listening. Perfect when I want to tune out my world and enter another one. 
They also fit comfortably over my ears and stay put! They are super light weight which I also love! 
These are better quality than the other leading brands and I will continue to buy this brand!

Verified Buyer Reviewed by Rnrk - October 11, 2023 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Worth every dollar! I've owned some less expensive headphones from Sennheiser and Sony. The price point of the WH1000XM - series used to make me think twice, but when I tried them at the store, the sound quality and the noise cancelling performance really stood out.

I've had a pair of these for over a year now, and I've used them almost everyday - they're robust, and have held up very well. Build quality is great.

EFerg - October,5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Extreme quality sound and product! Reviewed by EFerg - October 9, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sony WH-1000XM5 has an excellent quality on sound, product and presentation! Again, Sony doesn’t disappoint. The product presentation was high class. The case that stores the headphones is super nice and has a spot for the cables. Let’s get to the good part, sound. The noise canceling was very noticeable. The sound is, quality to the max! I watched a movie and it was great, I took a phone call and it was great. The phone call, person on other end could kinda hear a conversation going on in background (about 6ft away) but my voice was the more prominent. I love the memory foam cushions around the ear and headband which makes for hours of listening time. Connection to my phone was a breeze.

DavidZ - January,1,"Customer rating: 1 out of 5 stars I returned them and am way happier w Bose QC45 Verified Buyer Reviewed by DavidZ - January 8, 2023 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I went from Bose QC35 for four years to these yet after two road trips, I returned them and bought some Bose QC45s and are way happier.  The #1 reason is the head band is so narrow the weight of the cans hurt my head enough to give me a headache.  This was after 4+ hours so if you are walking on campus for 10 mins, this may not be an issue.  I also like how the Bose has volume buttons.  They are far faster to adjust than swiping over and over without accidentally skipping forward or back.  I also like how the Bose have an R and L prominent in the cups so you can quickly see what goes where compared to a small R on the Sony.  Also, the Bose fold and the case is both nicer and smaller.  Plus, the Bose are less expensive. Granted, you can upload photos of your ears to supposedly analyze them for better sound but who does that?  I believe the sound is just as good in the Bose as the Sony’s for 99.5% of those who can afford either pair.

"Toggge - June 9,",5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Great sound Reviewed by Toggge - June 9, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My first set of over-ear headphones for many years. 
First impression: A smart carry case, with a fabric finish that I really like, perhaps a little large so it goes in a backpack. I found that the case could take a small battery pack to the headphones can recharge. 
The noise cancelling is fabulous. You can listen to music in the same room as someone watching TV and have no interruption.
On to a not so good. There are lots of booklets full of data, but no instruction manual. In theory you need to download a Sony app to be able to change the sound style, it takes a while. I found that when using the app if the phone is in my back pocket, it can randomly turn off or change the settings. In a jacket pocket this doesn’t happen. 
There’s an option to sign up for 360 degree sound, but it doesn’t work with any well know music app that I have on my phone.
So what is my conclusion. Primarily I use the headphones without the app, the sound is sumptuous, even on trains and planes, Fantastic for travel, for more active use I use Sony in ear.
Ease of set up 60%

awh11 - January,5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars The Best Headphones I've Used Reviewed by awh11 - January 12, 2023 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I believe the hype now. These honestly are the best pair of headphones I’ve used. To me it all comes down to fundamentals: the sound and noise canceling quality are unrivaled. The headphones were comfortable and surprisingly slim for this type of headphone.

Given the press about the 1000X line I expected the quality to be great, but I also found some unexpected surprises in the touch interface, notably being able to “cover” your ear cup with your hand to pull in ambient sound and lower the volume so you can hear something or talk with someone for a second. Another surprise was how much customization is at your fingertips with the Headphones Connect app.

Any complaints I have are generally pretty trivial: the included USB cable is laughably short and isn’t of much help, and the badges in the Headphones Connect app felt a bit egregious when you clear out a notification dot because you changed an EQ setting. I easily got past both of those knowing the fundamentals are rock solid.

For anyone in the market for a pair of premium headphones, I can’t recommend these enough. Review originally posted on bestbuy.com Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",Positive

I have enjoyed these headphones for their phenomenal noise, cancellation. They have amazing adoptability in the app on how much or little noise canceling you would like how you would like the headphones to sound if you would like the headphones to adjust automatically to your surroundings or you adjust it manually. The app and headphones are designed to be easy to use yet. Give you complete control.
I use these headphones every day and having it be a large 30 hour battery life with ANC on is incredible. I am a very heavy user of the headphones and love the battery life, comfort, ease of use, solid connectivity, great sounding audio.
I’m a student and do a lot of video editing work, these headphones, allow me to focus on my work and not get distracted by all the noise in activity around me.
One minor complaint is the previous models of Sony‘s wireless headphones all were collapsible, and the earmuffs folded in this model is not collapsible, which makes it harder to store in my bag since the carrying case is much larger, and I frequently grab the headphones backwards since that earmuffs fold the opposite direction of the previous models.

Howesy999 - June,5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Top sounding headphones with great features. Reviewed by Howesy999 - June 15, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Having previously used sony headphones including the wh-xb700, I looked forward to trying out this model when it arrived. Day 1 and i got straight on to testing them out. The packaging being recyclable is great for those who want the latest tech, bit not to destroy the enviroment. The next bonus was the case. On my last headphone review I really wanted top brand headphones to have a case to keep them in top nick. Sony havent disappointed here with a solid case including a nice little part for the wires. 
The design: 
Lightweight but sturdy these headphones ooze quality. The buttons are easy to use and the phones look good to match the sound quality. They are cofortable to wear and suitable for use of a short journey or longer listening experience. 
Features:
These things come with so many features you will not be able to imagine them all. Top of my list is the ability to hover your hand over them to hear whats going on. Great for kids who just shout over the top. I love the swipe up etc for volume and next tune. Downloading the app lets you play further making these a great bit of tech. 
Sound:
Well this is the most important feature for a headphone and Sony havent let us down. Trying a plethora of music and movies over these and i couldnt find fault. Weather you be at home, out and about or on a busy bus the sound quality and noise reduction is top notch. 
Putting the headphones through a sound check even made me jump when testing the binaural sound check(getting up to answer the door to find it was just my headphones i had on).

I came from the XM3 to the XM5. I had the XM5 on my head for one hour and the impression made on my head is as shown on the photos. The headband was not pressed down hard. Perhaps this is an allergic reaction to the material.
The ear pads are thinner than both the XM3 and XM4. I cannot say for certain if they would have become very uncomfortable after wearing for a long time becuase I never had the headphones on for a long time.

I wore them very often, but I was always really gentle with them. I purchased them about a year and a 3 months ago. One day the hinge just snapped off. I wasn't doing anything strenuous. It just broke randomly because of the poor hinge design. The warranty is only one year (for the price it should be longer!), so I can't get a replacement, but it's not even covered by the warranty because they don't include physical damage.

"Mel2955 - May 27,",5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Much improved sound quality and comfort Reviewed by Mel2955 - May 27, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sony have excelled once again improving from the previous WH-1000XM4 headphones which I didn't think was possible. These headphones are definitely more comfortable to wear for longer periods in part because the of the shape of the earcups, but more so because of the improved feel of the soft leather padding around the earcups. They also appear to provide much better soundproofing from exterior noise as they fit closer to the shape of your face, and that's without switching on Noise Cancelling which is excellent.
Putting the headphones onto your head is now so much easier with the sliding headband, no more clicky settings, they just fit first time and I found the band very comfortable, possibly more so than the 1000XM4's. As for the touch controls on the right earcup, I think sensitivity may have been improved as sliding my finger up and down or across the cup face worked first time every time.
Taking phone calls also worked very well, could hear my caller no problem and same for the person calling hearing me clearly. The voice pickup to temporarily pause music playing when talking to someone is nice to have as well and didn't let me down, can be activated/de-activated in the Sony app, your choice.
As for sound quality, they are superb and is probably somewhat dependant on quality of the music files played. If you can play Flac/Lossless files using LDAC audio then you will love them as Sony have clearly done work on improving all aspects of the sound stage. I have played Classical, Pop, Rock and Electronic music files and in my opinion the instrument separation from bass through middle to treble was much clearer, especially in the top range. Bass wasn't overbearing, but you can make it so from your sound source and it might overtake the mid to high notes, but everyone has their own preference, just saying you can boom the bass if you want it.
All in all I think Sony have a winner once again. If I was to find one thing I didn't like so much, it's the case. I know its a different setup to the folding 1000XM4's case which I really like, albeit you can't fold that down flatter like the one provided with the 1000XM5. A minor niggle that doesn't detract from a great pair of headphones. Review originally posted on sony.com Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",Positive
occasionalstan,5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars These might just be as good as it gets.......... Reviewed by occasionalstan - May 30, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Ok, these are the first 'over the head' high quality wireless headphones I have used and I have to say they have set the bar really high. I have some top end wired Sony Hi Res headphones with no noise cancelling along with some competitors wired noise cancelling headphones and these beauties are on par if not better than both. 
Firstly the aesthetics are very good, you receive them in a Sony blended material box that might be completely recycled but has a nice solid feel to it and looks nice. 
Then, when you open up inside is the carry case which may be a bit thicker than I'd like but I'm happy to live with it as it keeps the contents safe. The first view of the WH-1000XM5 is impressive, nice matt finish with classy leather essentials that are very very comfortable indeed and I didn't find my ears getting too hot after 4 hours of continual wear. I'm not sure about all day comfortable but I don't think I could wear any headphones all day.
The side panel with all the little tweaks and tricks is a joy to use after looking at the accompanying guide and very quickly becomes intuitive. This is very cleverly done and it seems they were developed with someone who has a similar brain to me because they just work.
The sound is really really good with full range and depth, I don't know if I'm imagining it but feel it's not quite as expansive as when they are plugged in via the included cable, that being said Marvin Gaye singing Mercy Mercy Me in Hi Res on my Xperia 5ii is absolutely sublime with all the layers coming through nicely and Marvins smooth voice an utter joy. 
The noise cancelling is really effective and again the handy side panel enabling you to just hold it to hear is so handy. It makes you feel like it is just you and the music which is exactly what I want. 
I have used the 360 audio before with other Sony headphones and I have to say these seem to get a bit more out of the separation truly surrounding you with glorious sound.
I subjected them to War Of The Worlds Multi Channel and it was absolutely stunning, I was completely lost for the duration, hanging on to Richard Burtons every word and emerged into the story completely.
The bluetooth range is outrageously good compared to anything else I have, with the phone in the house I can reach the end of my garden (30m+) with ease and that's on 'Sound quality preferred' setting!
All in all I'm struggling to find fault with these at all, maybe the price but realistically is there anything better out there? I'm not sure there is. Review originally posted on sony.com Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",Positive
SiamI - August,5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Master piece Verified Buyer Reviewed by SiamI - August 17, 2023 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you're looking for a pair of headphones that can deliver superb sound quality, noise cancellation, and comfort, you might want to check out the Sony - WH1000XM5 Wireless Noise-Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones - Black. These headphones are the latest model from Sony's acclaimed WH1000XM series, and they offer some impressive features and improvements over their predecessors.

The first thing you'll notice about these headphones is their sleek and elegant design. They have a matte black finish, soft leather ear pads, and a sturdy metal headband. They also come with a carrying case, a USB-C cable, an audio cable, and an airplane adapter. The headphones are lightweight and foldable, making them easy to store and carry around.

The second thing you'll appreciate about these headphones is their sound quality. They have 40mm drivers that produce rich and balanced sound across various genres and volumes. They also have adaptive sound control, which automatically adjusts the sound settings based on your environment and activity. Whether you're listening to music, podcasts, or movies, you'll enjoy a clear and immersive audio experience.

The third thing you'll love about these headphones is their noise cancellation. They have dual microphones that detect and cancel out ambient noise from both sides of the headphones. They also have a noise-canceling optimizer, which analyzes the shape of your head, ears, and glasses to optimize the noise cancellation performance. You can also adjust the level of noise cancellation using the touch controls on the right ear cup or the Sony Headphones Connect app on your smartphone. With these headphones, you can block out any unwanted distractions and focus on your sound.

The fourth thing you'll admire about these headphones is their comfort. They have soft and cushioned ear pads that fit snugly over your ears without causing any pressure or fatigue. They also have a swivel and tilt mechanism that allows you to adjust the fit and angle of the headphones according to your preference. The headphones have a battery life of up to 30 hours with noise cancellation on, and they support fast charging via USB-C. You can also use them as wired headphones with the included audio cable.

The fifth thing I have  enjoy about these headphones is their smart features. They have touch controls on the right ear cup that let you play, pause, skip tracks, adjust volume, activate voice assistants, and answer calls with a simple tap or swipe. They also have a speak-to-chat feature, which automatically pauses the music and lets in ambient sound when you start talking to someone. They also have a quick attention mode, which lets you lower the volume and hear what's going on around you by placing your hand over the right ear cup.
The Sony - WH1000XM5 Wireless Noise-Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones - Black are truly one of the best headphones on the market today. They combine excellent sound quality, noise cancellation, comfort, and smart features in a stylish and durable package. They are worth every penny if you're looking for a premium listening experience. Review originally posted on bestbuy.com Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",Positive
"Mike - May 24,",5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Unbelievable noise canceling! Excellent sound! Reviewed by Mike - May 24, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you're looking for the best active noise canceling, over-ear headphones... look no further! The quality of noise canceling is second to none, somehow, Sony has taken the best ANC headphones and improved the ANC! 

Okay, on to the review. The Sony WH-1000XM5s have amazing sound quality, a nice finish (the black does attract fingerprints, at least at first), very comfortable for extended wear, and easily adjustable. The only thing I wish would have been kept around is the ability to fold the headphones like the previous versions, the case for the XM5s is a bit bulky, but you can clip it to a backpack or slide it into a bag pretty easily. The case also holds an included USB-C charging cable and 3.5mm cable in a magnetically sealed compartment and covers the entirety of your high-end headphones, unlike some of Sony's competitors. The thinner headband is nice, I can't really speak to how it may affect one's hair, but it leaves a smaller headband imprint on my bald head and has a barely there feel to it. The earcups are very comfortable and have ample room, even for those with bigger ears! 

They retain some of the best features of Sony's other ANC headphones, such as: touch controls on the ear cup, cover-to-speak/hear ambient mode, ANC/Ambient/""normal"" mode button, 3.5mm ability, highly adjustability in the Sony Headphones app, auto-mode switching based on activities.

The ambient mode has the ability to focus on voices, instead of just the general ambient noise and the ability to adjust the level of the ambient noise let in is a very nice feature to have. Pairing that with the auto-mode switching and ""speak-to-chat,"" which switches the headphones to voice-focused ambient mode when you begin to speak and turns off after a predetermined (and adjustable) amount of time, make for an amazing set of headphones for working in the office, taking on flights, trains, busses, and walking around. Now, they are not claimed to be water or sweat-resistant or IP rated in any way, kind of a bummer on for headphones that seem as though they'd be a perfect pairing for running or working out, but most of the nicer headphones lack an IP rating. In my testing of them, they've held up to some pretty sweaty runs. I do dry them off immediately and leave them off and out of their case for about an hour afterwards and they look, sound, and function perfectly. Something that each individual will have to decide if they're willing to take that risk with such a nice set of headphones.

Overall, I would definitely recommend the Sony WH-100XM5s to those looking for great audio quality for music, videos, and calls with amazing active noise cancelation for the times you wish to be isolated from outside noise. I could see these being a perfect fit for a frequent traveler, a music loving office worker looking to focus, and anyone who likes to head the world around them in excellent clarity while wearing their over-ear headphones! I am absolutely loving these and think they're worth the bump in price from the previous generation (XM4) by improving on the previous generation in all ways except for the ability to fold.

"GrenA - June 1,",5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Great upgrade to an already great product Reviewed by GrenA - June 1, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased my first noise cancelling headphones in 2017 and, after a significant amount of research decided on the MDR-1000X. I have been extremely happy with the quality of these products to the extent that I then purchased my wife a pair of WH-1000XM3, the upgraded version of my headphones in 2019. We were both extremely happy with the design, comfort, ease of use and quality of the products. The main reason for purchasing them was for travelling, and making long-haul flights more enjoyable without the distraction of the plane and other background noises. The WH-1000XM5 are, however, a significant step up from these previous products.
Firstly, the headphones feel significantly lighter, which is always a plus for travelling.
The previous versions used to fold away into their carry case with a bit of twisting, which I always was worried about in case of getting it wrong, having to double check each time that I folded the correct ear. To be fair, it was easy enough, but with this pair, there is no need for this and they simply fold flat back into their case, which makes easier The carry case is a bit bigger, which therefore takes a bit more room in your hand luggage, but has room within it for all cabling (audio and charger), which is a good.
I actually think the latest version are more comfortable as well - but it is marginal.
I always felt noise cancelling was great on the previous product and it is equally so on the new version. The big plus for me is that there is now no need to run the noise cancelling optimiser for different surroundings. OK, it was fairly simple by pressing a button, but it took about a minute to complete. There is no need for this with the XM5's, as apparently they auto optimise based on your surroundings - which is great.
There are other new features that you have to get used to:
- the headphones automatically pause what you were listening to when you take them off, and restart when you put them back on - confusing at first when testing, when you think you must have pressed something by accident, but it is a feature which is quite useful
- similarly, if you start speaking, the headphones recognise this, pause your music and switch to ambient mode so you can hear - ideal for when you are asked if you want a drink on the plane!
Apparently you can pair the headphones to 2 devices simultaneously, in case you are listening to music on a laptop but want to still receive calls!? That is not really relevant for me, so I have not tried it.
Battery life is claimed at 30 hours and a 10 minute charge apparently provides 5 hours of battery use. Again, I cannot validate these figures - but have not experienced any issues. In short, they charge quickly and last a long time!
Sound quality is pretty important when buying headphones and this is where they come into their own, and I personally think they offer a much fuller sound than my original 1000X, with impressive bass. They are a real step up.
In summary, these are really excellent headphones from every perspective and I was pleasantly surprised at how they improved on what I previously thought were perfectly adequate 1000X. I am very happy that I have the new ones, especially as now we can fly again so hopefully I will get chance to use them more often.

"gtdad - May 24,",4,"Customer rating: 4 out of 5 stars Great Technology with Design Drawbacks Reviewed by gtdad - May 24, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Sony WH-1000Xm5 is the latest version of the best noise cancelling headphones available today.

I also have the Sony WH-1000Xm3 and the Bose QC 45, which I will compare in this review.

There is a lot of great technology, however Sony made some design choices which may make this not suitable for everyone.

Out of the box the first thing you notice is the size of the case.  It is approximately 30% larger than the Xm3 and about 40% larger than the QC45. This is due to the new design of the Xm5 which do not fold. This is an unfortunate trend, as Bose, Apple and Microsoft headphones don’t fold either. I use noise cancelling headphones predominantly for travel. My backpack or carryon has limited space. Carrying 2 of these headphones (for myself and my wife) now takes up the space of 3 foldable headphones.

Also included in the case is the headphone cable and a ridiculously small charging cable. So small that it is basically unusable.

The double prong airline adapter is no longer included, which is fine since I have never used one and I don’t know if any airline uses that anymore.

The headband is now rounder and slimmer. I found the new design to be less comfortable than the flatter design of the other headphones as the contact with your head is now concentrated in a smaller area. If you have a thick head of hair, you may not notice this. However, if you have thinning hair or you are bald I think you will notice this.

The ear cups now have a wider opening which will be more comfortable for most people.

However, the ear cup padding is only half as thick and softer than the Xm3 and this causes  a couple of issues. (See attached picture).

The padding compresses too easily and goes into the ear cup. This is not only less comfortable, it also affects the seal around your ears which results in noise leakage. The first time I used the noise cancelling I was shocked at how poor it was. After several uses I realized that the ear cup foam was not sealing properly. When I pushed the ear cups closer to my ears by holding both sides of the headband the noise cancelling was incredible. The foam is too soft and too thin. Sony should definitely offer a replacement which is thicker. This would be an easy and inexpensive fix.

I weighed the Xm5 at 249 grams, the Xm3 at 254 grams and the QC 45 at 235 grams. You can feel a sight difference compared to the Xm3, however the Bose is still noticeably lighter.

The Xm5 in black is also a fingerprint magnet. This is especially bad because the headphone controls require your finger to swipe the earcups.

Finally, there is no voice announcement when you turn the power on. I am used to hearing that the power is on and which device I am connected to. Instead all you get is a couple of guitar sounding notes when you turn it on and when it connects.

Now on to the great technology.

Initial pairing with my Pixel phone was instantaneous. Connection is fast and stable.

Noise cancellation, when ear cups are sealed properly, is incredible. Far better than the QC 45 and noticeably better than the Xm3, especially with higher frequencies.
The Xm5 can connect to 2 different devices.
Phone calls are much better than any  other headphone I have used. The conversation is loud and clear on both ends while the Xm5 completely block out the noise from your surroundings. The other party will think that you are in a quiet room no matter your surroundings. Ambient sound quality is also improved and can now be adjusted automatically depending on your surroundings.

The Xm3 required you to go to the app and do it manually.

Sound quality for music and voice is also excellent, and is adjustable with EQ settings in the app.

Battery charge lasts up to 30 hours, which is excellent. However, fast charging is improved with a 3 minute charge giving you up to 3 hours of use, when charged with a PD adapter.

Other features like Speak to Pause and Remove Headphones to Pause work great and are very useful.

In summary, the tech is top notch , the design is not (at least for me). I realize that we are all built differently and some of the negatives I mentioned may not affect you.  And Sony could easily fix the sound leakage with thicker foam pads.
Therefore, I would recommend the Sony WH-1000Xm5 only if you can try them on first. Review originally posted on bestbuy.com Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",Positive

SonyWH1000XM5Navy,4,"Customer rating: 4 out of 5 stars Great Features Reviewed by SonyWH1000XM5Navy - January 31, 2024 I bought this a few months ago and I’m happy that I did. I bought it to use in conjunction with Elgato Wave XLR and Wave DX as part of my gaming set up #wildflame71. The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones connect to the Elgato products via the Twelve South Airfly Pro aptX compatible wireless transmitter/receiver and enable wireless sound via Bluetooth. This is successful and once you have the hang of it fairly straightforward. The cushions are memory foam and a good size - my husband has a pair too and is happy with the fit. Multipoint connectivity is a great feature and phone calls connect seamlessly whilst switching from my Twelve South Airfly Pro via the Sony Headphones App to my iPhone 15 Pro. The App walks you through setup of the headphones easily. Adaptive Sound Control, Speak to Chat and 30 hours of battery life make this headset an excellent choice whatever your activity.

"Michi - July 10,",5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars These are Amazing! Verified Buyer Reviewed by Michi - July 10, 2023 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love these headphones. I’ve used them for over a month now and have to say I’ve honestly never had headphones that are so comfortable and fit so well. They’re my first pair of expensive over the ear headphones, so I was worried they would squeeze my head tight, but I’ve even fallen asleep with them and felt fine! I’ve worn them for hours on end, the battery does last a while even when not fully charged. The app for the headphones could be a little bit more user friendly and have a few bugs worked out, but it’s still easy enough to use. Pairing is simple, it even paired to the Bluetooth on my television. These are also my first noise cancelling headphones, and it’s really nice! It even worked well for me when I was sewing on my sewing machine and my partner was playing video games next to me. The music on a low volume was still enough to completely drown out everything too.

Maltourus - October,3,"Customer rating: 3 out of 5 stars Poor design for longevity or repairability Verified Buyer Reviewed by Maltourus - October 28, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sound good, look goofy, feel ok. Worse noise canceling than the wh-1000xm3. If you are a soft hipster type who doesn't know what a hammer is for the rubber coating might not start wearing off in a month or two. Maybe don't mow the lawn with them, or paint, or do anything but sit sweat-sweat free staring at your phone. They are not German Shephard proof.  If the headband needs to be replaced there is a cable that attaches the two sides that runs through the bracket where the connector cannot fit. Thus, to do any significant repair to the headband, including the soft, ultra delicate faux rubber around the padding you better know where to source and how to crimp on an extraordinarily brittle 16 pin connector. Thank god for ebay and electrical tape. I won't be winning any fashion awards with my Frankenphones. If I had known they were so difficult to repair I wouldn't have purchased.

Crivrex - March,4,"Customer rating: 4 out of 5 stars It’s still a great product, but… Verified Buyer Reviewed by Crivrex - March 22, 2024 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The headset is as good as the XM4 with better drivers. The regular listener won’t be able to tell the difference between these and the previous XM4. Only thing I don’t like is they went with a thinner top cushion and a cheap organic material for the ear cups which makes it feel more in the 250 dollar range off the get go and not 350-400 dollars. The top cushion will make your head irritated after a while making me have to shift it back and forward. Makes it itchy. They should have kept the width of the XM4’s for the top. Noise isolation is good but I feel like the cheap material is making some sound to come in. This is a stipulation and would have to try the XM4’s again to verify this. Ear cushion could have used a bit more cushion. They are supper soft and push in too much. I’m interested to know more about the XM6 and may return these if they fix some of my preferred things I mentioned otherwise, these will have to do.

Personally I like to purchase items based off of quality at an affordable price, I will say that these are little more on the $$$ side but it is 100% worth it if you value great sound quality. Overall the default setting for the sound is really good but the fact that you can select from multiple pre-made settings as well as customize your own is a really unique and thoughtful feature, it allows you to play with the sounds of the music and adjust them to fit your specific listening style. Not only is the quality of the sound impeccable but the style and comfort of the headphones is also very modern and comfortable. From the stone/tan color that looks great and doesn't leave any visible grease marks from your fingers or face to the soft, pillowy cushioning around the hears and headband that makes you forget your wearing headphones at all. Another great feature is the touch responsive surface on the sides of the headphones, it is super helpful and does away with the bulkiness of buttons and on a single charge these headphones have lasted through an entire roadtrip from Houston to Orlando.

"MrC72 - April 7,",5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Simply Amazing Reviewed by MrC72 - April 7, 2023 I have been using the Sony WH-1000XM5 now for almost 2 weeks and all I can say is simply amazing 
I come from a background of enjoying soundbars, a decent set of headphones will blow any sound bar out of the water.
Typical Sony build quality, I like the simplistic design and comfort and controls are easy to use, the app makes everything easy to set up.
I can't honesty think of anything negative to say, if I was being nit picky, the outer plastics are a bit of a finger print magnet (skin grease).
My hats off to you Sony, a fantastic product, superb sound quality and a simple yet fantastic comfortable design.

Highly recommend. Review originally posted on sony.com Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",Positive
"SL289 - July 27,",5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars A worthy successor Reviewed by SL289 - July 27, 2024 I bought these as an upgrade to my ageing WH1000 XM3’s. I’ve worn my XM3’s pretty much every day for the last nearly 6 years (Oct 2018 - July 2024) and they’re starting to play up (noise cancelling is being weird, and the ear cups are deteriorating along with the headband), but when they work they’re still the best headphones I’ve ever owned. They’ve got great sounding audio and incredible noise cancelling, along with being very well built and so comfortable. I often wear my XM3’s for 8 hours a day at work, along with while I’m walking my dogs, cutting the grass, washing the car - they’ve just been awesome. That’s why I decided to get some XM5’s in the Prime Day sales, and I’m so glad I did. The XM5’s not only sound better, but the noise cancelling is also improved. I don’t find the head band quite as comfortable as the XM3’s, but I’ve maybe just not dialled them in yet. They feel arguably better built, though they’ve lost the folding feature - no huge loss though, just a larger footprint when not in use. I truly am blown away by the improvements in sound and noise cancelling, along with the QoL improvements like being able to connect to 2 devices and audio pausing when you take them off. I bought them in the hope they’d be as good as my XM3’s, and in the hope they’d be better, but they’ve surpassed my expectations. The carry case is larger than the XM3’s due to the loss of folding ear cups, but feels just as sturdy, great for travelling. My XM3’s have had over 10,000 hours of use over nearly 6 years and are still going, fingers crossed the XM5’s do just as well.

"Kadete - May 31,",5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Full of feature with outstanding sound Reviewed by Kadete - May 31, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is definitely the best over the ear head set Sony has come up with. I own several Sony products, but this headset has become my favorite. Now for the GOOD things. It comes with a cable to convert from wireless to wired headset. The feel is very smooth like silk or silicon cover. In addition, the battery life and range distance are great compared to my in-ear set. It comes with a nice carrying case with is of good quality. 
One of the best features is the auto on/off of the noise cancellation control. When I start talking, ambient sound comes on and will stop the music. Once I stop talking noise cancelling restarts and so does music. Despite a few things that are not great, the app is easy to use and full of useful features including turning off the headset from the phone. It is a very light weight and very comfortable headset worth of any music lover consideration. The controls and instructions to use them are clear and easy to follow both in print and online. A couple to things I should mention that I do not like but are not worth removing a start. First, it is not water resistant, second the app has the 360 sound feature that it does create a better listening experience but it is too invasive by taking pics of one's ears. The second is that is does not have a complete noise canceling, it is more like a noise reducing capability. While it does reduce the ambient sound significantly, the noise cancelling is not so as effective as the in-ear Sony headset I have. The charging cable is extremely short for such high end headset.
It's a very nice, soft, comfortable great sounding headset full with nice features. Review originally posted on bestbuy.com Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",Positive
RezDogDre - February,1,"Customer rating: 1 out of 5 stars Manufacturer defect/Sony wont honor warranty Verified Buyer Reviewed by RezDogDre - February 12, 2025 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Been using the Sony XM models since 2018 with the XM3's. Eventually to the XM4's and now the XM5's. I used my headphones roughly 8 hours a day pretty much every day and every pair held up just fine until the XM5's. This is my second pair of XM5's that have broken due to manufacture defect in the hinge. This hinge problem is a well known issue by Sony with hundreds of posts on various websites. Their own sony support forums has a post with over 12000 views for the hinge issue. For reference the rest of their posts only have a few hundred views, maybe breaking 1000 on one or two. The first pair of XM5's lasted 1 day after the warranty. The most recent pair only lasted 6 months. The only thing that has happened with these headphones is they go from my head to my desk to charge then back on my head the next day.

Sony refuses to honor their 1 year warranty for manufacturer defects. Instead of fixing their mistake they will try to charge you $100 to fix their defect. If you look at any of the other broken headphone posts on bestbuy or wherever. ITS ALWAYS at the hinge. This is a clear defect and Sony like all large corporations try to play innocent. check the pictures in the post. got one of both pairs and then the most recent pairs break

I really don't want to leave a one star review because these headphones sound AMAZING. and their battery life is fantastic and on top of that they charge quickly. 10-15 minutes and they are good to go usually. So if you are a minimum use headphone user these are probably okay if you got cash to spend, but i cannot recommend these. For $400 dollars a pop they should last more than a year.

"ebk02 - May 19,",4,"Customer rating: 4 out of 5 stars has many functions, good sound, comfortable Reviewed by ebk02 - May 19, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones offer a lot of flexibility, and functions in a lightweight over-the-ear headphone. 
The headphones are packed in a nice case, along with a couple cables - one for charging, and a 3.5 cable for listening directly.
The ear pads are very soft, conform well, and extremely comfortable. The headband is also nicely padded. The earcups swivel easily, and fit well on your ears. Overall - very comfortable. Should be able to use for hours without fatigue. 
The outer shell of the headphones seems to be a matt plastic.
There are a number of functions the 'phones can do by touching, tapping, or swiping the outer part of the earcup. Volume up / down, change track, etc. Download the Sony app - allows for setup, EQ, etc. 
I did not complete the ""360 degree"" as it involved a subscription, and other steps. It appears to be a method of adding different effects to music, that may be useful to some.
Now to the sound. I tested these with computer, phone, and MP player. I was amazed at the ambient cancellation - excellent - there was almost no sound bleed through. 
First I tested these wired directly, with classical, jazz, and classic rock - on all devices. Bass response was excellent - went to the lowest lows without booming. Then the mids seemed to have too much ""presence"". But the biggest disappointment was that the highs were very recessed. I then paired the headphones with each device. Bluetooth paring went perfectly with all devices. The sound was greatly improved - the treble was a little more balanced. I went back and forth numerous time to confirm....Using the EQ in the app, one should be able to customize the sound for personal liking.

Philipg50 - May,5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Best headphones Reviewed by Philipg50 - May 28, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sony who-1000m5 headphones

Had these phones for a week or so.
First impressions were that these are well built and extremely comfortable to wear,I kept them on for about four or five hours and they never felt uncomfortable or tight,very nice fit.I find that they work well on TV ,iPad and mobile phone.good USB c charging and audio cable.
They don't fold like my previous headphones,but they are quite compact and I was never sure if constant folding phones was a good idea anyway.They come in a nice case with cables enclosed.3Thirty hours from full charge and three minutes charge gives three hours life.
I did have a problem at first as the phones kept cutting out,every few seconds,I initialized them a couple of times and now they work fine.I tried them up to about sixty feet from mobile and they did well up to about fifty feet appx.
I am not a big audiofile, but I find the music is beautifully balanced and sounds like you are in the studio with the artists,so clear!even at higher volume.eight microphones and two processors give plenty of power.
You can also adjust settings to suit.
It is easy to switch between noise cancelling and ambient sound,and pairing was easy enough.Noise cancelling worked as expected,and a big step up from my other buds and headphones.
The right cup can be used to mute just by cupping your hand over it,handy if needed,right cup is used for volume ,next track etc and if you take off phones it pauses 
I don't phone much anymore,but found that phone call was clear,and did not feel echoey 

All in all I am very pleased,best headphones I have ever had,and I've had a few.I would thoroughly recommend,after all,they are Sony! Review originally posted on sony.com Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",Positive
"HoMi3 - May 23,",5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Sony continues to show why they're a premium brand Reviewed by HoMi3 - May 23, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you take with you anything from my review just take away this: If you want one of the best noise cancellation experiences TRY THESE! 

With a bump in microphones from last year's model, you now have 8 microphones that enhance the noise cancellation experience and call quality. The audio optimizer really helps to detect the environment that you are in and your conditions in order to give you the audio quality that you are looking for in a premium set of headphones. 

Sound, is without a doubt one of the best take a ways from these headphones. It is magic, the way they make the 2 processors work to detect noise and provide your ears with crisp and magnificent sounding audio. You even have an optimizer within the headphones app that you can control to your liking. I personally think the default ""Bright"" is a great setting to get a well rounded sound. When taking calls you can hear your caller well and the 4 microphones used to detect your voice do a great job to focus in on your voice and cancel out any other ambient noise so your caller can clearly hear your voice.  

Other things of note: 
- 30 hours of battery life is great but what is even crazier is that with just 3 minutes of charging you can get 3 HOURS of playback if you need to go on say a flight and want to carry these headphones along.  
- I HATE that these headphones do not flip the ear phones inward but instead flip outward when you hang them around your neck. This is pretty awkward being that you are exposing your ear phones out. 
- I've noticed that the auto pause when you take off the headphones is hit or miss sometimes.
- Storing these headphones flat isn't bad but I wish they could fold in to minimize their space a bit more. Review originally posted on bestbuy.com Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",Positive
JudithO - August,1,"Customer rating: 1 out of 5 stars Good Sound, Poor Design, NOT for frequent use. Verified Buyer Reviewed by JudithO - August 13, 2023 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I upgraded to this set from my WH1000XM3 which I had for 4 years.  The 3 had great sound and noise canceling ability.  I used them frequently and wore them out.  I was happy to get this pair in January of 2023.  by August the earpiece connection had broken.  Its not considered a warranty item even though it is under warranty.  Repair would cost nearly as much as a new pair.  The redesign of the connectors (much thinner than the 3 and the 4) has built in accelerated obsolescence.  If you plan to use these often you would be better with the better designed 4 version.

lindros2 - May,5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars The best over-the-ear headphones in 2022 Verified Buyer Reviewed by lindros2 - May 22, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My ""daily driver"" headphones are in-ear Beats Fit Pro and AirPods Pro; wired Westone W40 (airplanes); and Bose QC35 ii (which for some reason has started to disconnect from my iPad Pro).

These are the best, but I do not plan to take from home except on trips (due to their size and the case).

Pros
- Noise cancelling is absolutely the best for white noise (my AirPods Pro - latest firmware - has lost 80% of noise cancellation)
- I can play music super low - like 5-15% of total. I can't imagine what ""loud"" is on these...
- Sound stage is excellent. I haven't had to mess with the EQ nor on-device bass reduction, even though strong bass gives me a headache
- Bluetooth connection is good with Apple products (I haven't tried multi-device connect - which works really well with Bose and Apple headphones - because I don't want to disable LDAC)
- The app isn't bad. Quirky, okay, but there are a lot of controls - and you can see Sony has improved it over the past 2-3 years with more functionality
- Speak-to-pause works well (disables noise cancellation and you can talk with others). Some quirks to it - i.e. if you manually turn on passthrough it will accidentally turn on noise canc ... this happens sometimes..
- Fit is comfortable compared with others (Bose QC35/45 have also been good to me)
- Bluetooth connection is stable 50+ feet from the source. If this becomes a problem, you can disable some things to get greater distance

Cons
- The ""cabin pressure"" of Sony headphones appears greater than Bose
- They do get warm on my ears - the ""leather"" is plasticky
- The matte plastic coating picks up fingerprints and oil like nothing else
- They cut out a bit on certain iOS sources - I need to investigate as it might be either alerts or something else confusing the Bluetooth source
- Music pause (when removed from ears) always works. But resume only works about 20-30% of the time.
- Touch controls can be infuriating at times. I've disabled, but it still makes the touch sound...
- Dog barking and people talking still leaks through. I presume so will airplane announcements - they've had to do this for safety reasons

Cost cutting
- The case is really cheap - I'm guessing the zipper will break within weeks
- The blue power/pairing light isn't helpful - they should have used green/blue/red for on/off status (cost cutting) - and doesn't show solid as you're turning it off
- The USB port - Type C - seems cheap/weak. This could be an issue real soon.
- The outside box, as well, is super cheap. You have to nearly tear it apart to get the headphone box out. [UNBOXING is awful]
- They came - on day 1 - only charged 63%. That seemed a bit odd for a new release...

And they are expensive - $400 is not cheap, yet the case and box are really cheap. Review originally posted on bestbuy.com Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",Positive
swinterlover -,5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Very sleek looking headphones Reviewed by swinterlover - December 1, 2023 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very nice, comfortable and flexible.

I love that its case also comes with an inside flap to hold your charger, it’s very convenient and I never lose my charger because of it. Charges very fast and the battery lasts minimum of a week. A little pricey but I’d say it’s a worthy purchase in the long run. Look just as brand new as they did a month ago when I purchased them. I’d say the only problem I have is that I prefer to not use noise cancellation, so sometimes I think because of the environment I’m in it will turn on NC by itself even after turning that feature off, otherwise no complaints.

Craigy1631 - June,5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Joy for the hard of hearing - Sony WH-1000XM5 Reviewed by Craigy1631 - June 7, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Upfront confession I'm a 60 plus male with Bluetooth hearing aids who is missing his music !!

While my hearing aids act as Bluetooth buds for my phone/tablet the quality of audio playback is such that I was on the point of giving up on music listening. For one last go I acquired the new Sony top of the range headphones and I'm so glad I did !!

On unboxing  I was surprised by the sleek new design which is quite unlike any previous headphones I've used or tested. I was pleased to see that there are no risky folding joints which always worry me and while the carrying case may be a little bigger because of this I really prefer this approach. Togethr the cans and case just ooze class.

I always prefer to see if I can operate a new device without reference to a manual or online video probably to prove I'm not too docile but also to see if enough attention has been paid to usability. One long press on the obvious power button and the usual flashing blue light was on for pairing. Two second look at my phone and I was off and running. (At the same time I disconnected my hearing aids from the phone to avoid any clash). I know there are various controls available via an app but for my first go I couldn't resist just using all defaults.

I stream from several sites all at the highest quality setting but as mentioned the hearing aids just can't cut it.  From an ergonomics point of view the headphones feel a little bigger and as such happily enclose my ears and the padding is soft and comfortable.

My preference is for live concert recordings and the minute the music started I new I was getting a quite different experience and memories of music pleasure were instantly rekindled. I was picking out specific instruments and band voices which recently have just been one blurred noise. The other thing that quickly emerged was the external noise cancelling which hit home when my wife tapped me on the shoulder to say she had been calling on me. Ah the joy !!!

Over the next couple days I downloaded the app and tried the headphones outside while walking the dog. First things first. I found the app really interesting as I still think of myself as a technofile but in all honesty other than upping the bass slightly I can easily live with the defaults. I did however try out the 360 music settings with a 360 source which brought a quite different to the whole immersive concert feel and was really enjoyable. When I went outside for the first time I had a ringing ""be careful"" from my wife as I cross a few busy roads. While the noise cancelling made a huge difference there was always enough of a background awareness that ensured I never felt at risk. For the first time in years I was able to enjoy my music with an outdoor experience.

Call quality and periodic use of my phone's online assistant worked perfectly with clear and usable ease in doors and out.

I can't compare these headphones to previous versions to highlight key changes/improvements but for me they have brought my listening back to a level I thought was long gone. Thank you Sony. Review originally posted on sony.com Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",Positive
Charles - April,4,"Customer rating: 4 out of 5 stars Great Headphones Verified Buyer Reviewed by Charles - April 11, 2025 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones offer a top-tier listening experience. The sound quality is exceptional, delivering rich and immersive audio. Comfort is clearly a priority in their design—the ear cushions are deep, plush, and remarkably soft, ensuring a snug yet gentle fit. The headband adds to this comfort with its soft padding, making these headphones ideal for extended use. Unlike some other models, they don't press too hard, avoiding headaches even during long sessions.

One downside, however, is the sensitive finish. It tends to show marks from grease or oil on your skin, which may require frequent cleaning to maintain its pristine appearance. Despite this, these headphones are a fantastic choice for anyone seeking premium noise-canceling technology with unmatched comfort.

Gabriel_yyj - August,1,"Customer rating: 1 out of 5 stars Great sound terrible build quality Verified Buyer Reviewed by Gabriel_yyj - August 4, 2025 I bought these for my wife for Christmas. She really liked them but after about a year the joint connecting the headband to the ear piece broke. This was just outside the warranty period, so we reviewed some videos to learn it is a common issue and follow some tips (e.g., try plastic weld). That worked for a few weeks, then the side broke, so we did the same thing, then it broke again, hence the duct tape. This was normal household wear, and I definitely would expect better from Sony and this price point. They have setup a service via Microland for headband repair, but that is another $150 and I would sooner put that toward new headphones with a different company.

Baylie - March,5,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 stars Lots of compliments about them being stylish Verified Buyer Reviewed by Baylie - March 10, 2024 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] They're the best ANC headphones I've found, and I've tried pretty much every mid and high end pair I could find. These cancel noise better, have better and fuller sound profiles, and are lighter weight and more comfortable on the head all day. I like the case it comes with too and the headphones not folding up, to me, is a pro. Battery life is amazing, I'm always plugging them in before they need it because I'm used to my things needing to be charged more.

Before this I often had to stop doing such tasks due to complaints of disturbances.
The main reason for this being rated 4 and not 5 is because it is not comfortable to wear continuously for over 2 hours.

The premium sound cancelling on these headphones is better than any headphones I've ever owned, compared to other more expensive options.

frustrateduser123,2,"Customer rating: 2 out of 5 stars Good audio marred by awful interface Reviewed by frustrateduser123 - February 10, 2026 I bought based on the Wirecutter review. First off:
Sound quality and noise cancellation: excellent.

So why 2 stars? Everything else about these is extremely frustrating. Can't use while charging. Unintuitive and confusing buttons to turn on, connect to bluetooth, and adjust noise cancellation - after year, I still don't know how to use them (I gave up long ago). ""Smart features"" are very dumb and auto-enabled: I clear my throat at my desk and music pauses. My default use is plugged in with a wire, no noise cancellation, because the UX of these is so frustrating and continues to frustrate me a year later.

Perhaps someone who enjoys tinkering with smart features in an app would enjoy these, but they've been the most frustrating experience I've ever had with headphones and I regret not returning them after getting them.

The app takes a little getting used to as there is a lot to learn but it’s worth it if you give it some time.

I had the original hinge break, and then paid for a replacement. It just broke too. I did not sit on it, twist it, or abuse it. It just wore out, cracked, and then broke clean through. Now, useless.

and i wasnt sure if these could top them but i was definitely wrong. 

Sound Quality 10/10 Great sound quality as always, i feel the 1 thing to improve on would be the ambient and not saying that its bad because its still fantastic but compared to the Airpod Max, there ambient is a tad bit better, but still works insanely great!

Bass 10/10 Sony giving us the option to adjust the bass through the app is great. I believe the bass is around the same quality as the XM4's except with this new sound quality i feel like it fits it very well and has an overall good match with it.

Design 9/10 Only because i personally liked the XM4's ability to twist and fold into a nice case. The case the XM5's come with are still good and have a nice magnet pocket to hold your cord accessories or anything that you want.

Battery Life 10/10 Super fast charging speeds so you dont have to worry about 1 hour charges. 3 min charge = 3 HOURS OF PLAYTIME! Review originally posted on bestbuy.com Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",Positive

Cons: the headband feels cheap since it is thinner than the previous plastic bands BUT since these lack that wayyy to easy to break plastic piece on previous versions, I'd say it is worth it and a design change that was overdue.

DerekE - August,4,"Customer rating: 4 out of 5 stars Really good sound but flimsy and expensive Verified Buyer Reviewed by DerekE - August 30, 2024 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] There are a lot of reviews suggesting these headphones are lacking in durability. I agree with this. I had to get a replacement in the 1st year because one of the speakers were damaged. I had exclusively used the headphones at my office job without ever dropping them or transporting them. The replacement pair I got with the warranty about a month ago are still working normally. When they work, they sound great, though I do find the construction rather flimsy for the price point. I also own Bose QC45 and I find them to be much sturdier with similar sound quality. I will say the noise cancelling on the Sony headphones is significantly better. Review originally posted on bestbuy.com Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",Positive

Rahim - August,3,"Customer rating: 3 out of 5 stars Quality of sound but price Verified Buyer Reviewed by Rahim - August 9, 2022 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As a music lover I can say this is outstanding piece. Stream music through Bluetooth without any breaking up. Only my concern material which Sony used. 400 dollars price tag is too much for me.

RoquetR - January,2,"Customer rating: 2 out of 5 stars Bad design, brittle headband Verified Buyer Reviewed by RoquetR - January 5, 2026 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Purchased this almost exactly 6 months to the day and the THIN part of the headband snapped in my hands as i was putting the headphones on... just ridiculously bad design. 

now they want me to pay $100 just to fix it... so pretty much the unit ends up being $400... absolutely worthless


other design issues
There's no way to quickly turn on and turn off the touch controls, so if it's raining and you put a hoodie on it will continuously trigger the touch controls and will shuffle everything around

similar to the above issue is the direction that the pads rotate; the pad rotate so that the touch controls are against your body, meaning the touch controls would get triggered randomly when your moving around! this also means the hard part of the pads are again your clavicle, which kinda hurts when you're moving around, or running.


Positives
Good sounds quality
Good noise canceling feature, but not as good as the WH-1000XM4, in my opinion


Honestly if you're looking into getting sony headphones, i would just the WH-1000XM4. but i wouldn't really bother getting any other sony products for myself. Review originally posted on bestbuy.com No, I would not recommend this to a friend.",Neutral
